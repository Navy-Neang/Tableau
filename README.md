## Overview
We have been task to determine what has been successful and what areas of sales need improvement by performing analysis on the regional sales data. We want to address the following questions. 

1. Which region of the US made the most sales and profit? 

2. Which categories in sales performed the best and by which sales channel? 

3. Is the Sales Team performing well?
